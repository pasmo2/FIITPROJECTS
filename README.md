# FIITPROJECTS
My school projects, unchanged to preserve authenticity  
All of the projects are split into folders based on the course they belong to.  
These courses are in descending chronological order(latest at the top).  
DBS - Database Systems - python and sql  
PKS - Computer and Communication Networks - python  
UI - Artificial Intelligence - python  
DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms - C  
Javascript game - This is a very old project, much simpler than the other projects - javascript  
  
OOP - This course's project can be given out upon request.
